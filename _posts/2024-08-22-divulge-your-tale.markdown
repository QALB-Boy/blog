Between 2001 and 2003 I was studying my A-Levels at Strodes college in Egham.

I loved music and I listened to all genres with a passion.

I had a brilliant Professor who helped me to love and enjoy Physics.

One open evening a 3d physics simulation that I had built was on display in the Physics classroom.

A few weeks later something happened.

I was visiting a friend for a party and on the way home, I was attacked at a train station.

I was kicked in the head mostly. The group who attacked were quite large in number.

This changed me forever.

Eventually I felt normal again but there was a lot of trauma.

A year later I was studying Physics at the University of London, Royal Holloway.

As I approached the end of my degree I started to feel a number of things.

I felt a deep loneliness in terms of spiritually.

I also had the idea for Quantum Sand, a free software app for learning that I wanted to build.

I wanted to help poor kids and adults who were denied an education.

As I felt more spiritual, I started to look into Abrahamic religions.

I realised that the truth of Islam made sense.

The same year that I accepted Islam, 2007, I went for Umrah.

I was sitting in front of the Kabah in Makkah and a desert bedouin told me: “Allah has chosen you for the garden”.

After accepting Islam, it took over two years before I discovered a Sufi tariqa.

I went to visit a group who are new Muslims.

The followers of Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi,  leader of the Darqawi-Shadhili-Qadiri Tariqa.

I felt something in the Sufi gatherings or hadra.

I believe Sufism is a science within Islam and not a sect.

Unfortunately I fell out with the followers of Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi.

I think I was stubbornly refusing to follow the teachings exactly.

I regret sincerely having disputes or unnecessary arguments with the Murabitun movement of Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi..

I want to sincerely apologise to the Sufi tariqa of Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi.

I miss them as a community.

I left the Murabitun and went back to Shepperton.

I started a political satire blog called The Muslim Prince dot com.

It was mostly extreme satire. I grew up reading Private Eye.

I was very critical of some of the foreign policies of the UK.

I received a visit from the British Police regarding my blog.

I agreed to remove my political blog from the internet.

Then there was a period of suffering from anxiety and insomnia lasting a long time.

For many years I have had an unjust slander against me which many people believe.

In 2006 I had, as mentioned already, the idea for making a free and open educational platform. The idea went through various name changes but is now called: Quantum Sand.

As mentioned it led me to become spiritual and I started to look into various Abrahamic religions.

Islam made the most sense to me.

In February 2007 I accepted Islam.

Over this period I started to have anxiety problems, thankfully I no longer suffer from anxiety anymore.

In August 2013 I had been sectioned. I was suffering from anxiety and insomnia.

The lying doctors at the Abraham Cowley Unit wrote up a false report that I had agreed to having the symptoms of schizophrenia.

I can state that I have never experienced those symptoms ever before.

The other psychiatrists all propagate the same lie apart from one private doctor who agreed with me that I do not have schizophrenia. She was unable to stand by me and get it revoked.

Therefore for many years I have had an unjust slander against me which most people believe.

In March 2024 I had been suffering with insomnia and was sectioned again.

At Melbury Lodge I had numerous slanders written onto my medical records.

First, bipolar and mania, which I have never experienced. 
Second, schizoaffective disorder, which I have never experienced.
Thirdly, back to schizophrenia, again which I have never experienced.

I am aware of a few of the lies being propagated by the Melbury Lodge doctors.

I was accused of visiting extremist websites at the same time that my laptop had been confiscated from me. So basically impossible.

I was accused of photographing other patients again, totally fabricated.

On the positive side, the forced medications made it feel like my body was becoming stronger the more pharma drugs I was forced to take.

I sincerely feel that my inner strength is only increasing on these forced medications.

I was next moved to Hollybank rehabilitation. After many months at Melbury Lodge.

I am increasingly thinking more and more about making Hijra to somewhere else. Hijra is where you move somewhere else for religious reasons.

I want to make Hijra so that I can leave this fictional schizophrenia slander behind me.

I am currently being forced to take 1300mg of Lithium for a disease that I do not have. I was being forced to take 40mg zuclopenthixol for a disease that I do not have. Now I am being forced to take 200mg of Clozapine for a disease that I do not have.

Therefore, I am strongly thinking of making Hijra. I have been looking at Saudi Arabia in particular.

I sincerely miss Makkah and Madinah.

Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi praised the Saudi Crown Prince, and I believe the changes in Saudi Arabia are exciting.

I would love to go back to Saudi Arabia.

If anyone has any ideas about me making Hijra and where to, then please do not hesitate to contact me via email, at andrewpottercv@gmail.com

I have my email in the description.

My hobbies include Chloe Ting Abs workouts, press ups to Jay-Z/Linkin Park. Running, listening to music, learning Arabic and learning about Islam.
