When I was studying Physics at the University of London Royal Holloway, I had an idea. What if there was a way to help teach poor kids and adults through an app?

My ambition is to help the whole Ummah. The Islamic World had the best education system in the world back in the day. I want to revive that spirit. I want to save the Ummah and other good people from being left behind in education.

## QALB-Boy app
The result of this thought process is now an app that is nearing completion for testing.

QALB-Boy is an educational art-game-storytelling platform. Written in React, Rust, Ruby-on-Rails, C++ and Qml. Blender is used for the artwork.

* React for the UI
* Rust for many of the video games
* Ruby-on-Rails for the core backend and P2P
* C++ for the Qt app
* Qml for everything you see in the Qt app
* GDScript and Godot for many video games

Machine learning is planned as a feature, so Python will be added to this list.

### Community collaboration

At some point it will be vital to form a community around this app if it is going to succeed.

I need volunteers who are good with:
* KDE
* GNOME
* Storytelling
* Blender Grease Pencil
* Translating locales
* React
* Ruby-on-Rails
* C++
* Qml
* Rust
* GDScript and Godot
* Desktop Linux
* Docker
* PyTorch
* Python
