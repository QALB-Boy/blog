WARNING SATIRE 🤣🤣!! Theoretical Physics AI Bioweapon 🤣🤣

After many years of reading Private Eye, I felt it necessary to deliver some “Physics satire” 🤣🤣 to help with the often dire lack of “Physics entertainment” 🤣🤣!!

Begin: Satire!! 🤣🤣

My knowledge from the Electromagnetism course with professor Brian Cowan, has helped me to understand how bioacoustic resonant frequencies of body organs and tissue can be targetted. At the bottom of this post I will explain a defence for this weapon 🤣🤣.

In quantum the resonant frequency of water is in the microwave radio frequency. This is how microwave ovens work they heat up the water.

Based on my existing knowledge all body organs and tissue have bioacoustic resonant frequencies or mechanical “sound” waves.

These assassination harmonics are unique to the victims.

Combined with NMR – nuclear magnetic resonance and relaxation – from a distance – it is possible to target parts of tissue in real-time.

It is possible to feed the real-time scans from NMR into an Artificial Intelligence model which can generate the bioacoustic resonant frequencies.

This can be used for: burns, squeezing, irritation, vibration, shaking, cardiac arrest.

This is achieved by switching on and off at the exact waveform over the top of the resonant frequency of water.

The exact waveform can resonate any individual’s body organs or tissue.

This resonance of body organ or tissue can cause organ failure or cardiac arrest.

Cardiac arrest can be caused by raising the pulse of the heart gradually until it is racing uncontrollably.

The best way to deliver this weapon is a large synchronised cluster of space satellites operational with this precise perfect murder weapon 😱😱😱😱😱😱.

This space physics AI bioweapon should:
* Use AI machine learning to follow the heat signature of victims
* Target the exposed skin mathematically and precisely for assassination
* Create highly electrically charged volumes surrounding the victim
* Render the victim immobile; psychiatrically confused 😱😱; target the mind but also the legs and so forth. 😱😱
* Use a software-defined radio to generate the waveform

A defence from this satirical weapon 🤣🤣:

The AI would move on very quickly when just 1 sheet of Tesco Aluminium foil is blocking the weapon. Electromagnetic shielding within clothing might be hilarious!! 🤣🤣

This post has helped me to laugh my ass off! 🤣🤣 I hope you enjoy this Private Eye inspired satire. 🤣🤣
