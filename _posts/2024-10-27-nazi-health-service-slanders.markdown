For many years, continuously, I made it clear how the vicious “Nazi” Health Service slanderous psychiatric records prevent me from having a girlfriend. The fear and doubt caused by the fictional medical records has been sufficient to ruin my life for years. The “Nazi” Health Service doctors pretend that their fictional slanders don’t destroy my life. The entire NHS structure needs Denazification.
