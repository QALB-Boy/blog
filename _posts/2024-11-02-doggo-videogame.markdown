In the summer of 2023 I started coding and designing a videogame called Doggo. 

I am using Blender 3d for the artwork and Rust lang alongside bevy for the 3d engine.

The key to the game is to answer mathematics questions to unlock surprises in this collaborative world building game.

Time limits to prevent addiction are planned for the platform.

Multiplayer is a planned feature.

Doggo was heavily inspired by Anastasia Opara:
