After lots of research between 2002 to 2003 I concluded that the physics department at Royal Holloway was the best or one of the best places to study physics.

I will be forever thankful for the brilliant staff who really helped to inspire me.

The campus is one of the most beautiful places that I have had the pleasure of receiving accommodation; Wedderburn and Gowar are beautiful.

In particular I have to thank Professor Brian Cowan for helping me a lot on various occasions throughout my degree.

In particular I overcame my own lack of self-belief that I can achieve anything when I put my mind to it.
